     Hi there, Iâ€™m glad you found me. My name is <span class="red"> Jarad Anthony Higgins</span> aka Juice Wrld.
    </div>
    <div class="about-text-content  text-scroll">
      Jarad Anthony Higgins, known professionally as Juice WRLD, was an influential American rapper, singer, and songwriter who emerged as a prominent figure in the music industry with his emotive and genre-blending style. Born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois, Juice WRLD was raised in a musical environment, learning to play piano, drums, and guitar at an early age. His stage name was inspired by the 1992 film "Juice," which he saw as a symbol of taking over the world.
    </br>
  </br>
      Juice WRLD first gained major attention with his 2017 single "Lucid Dreams," which became a massive hit in 2018, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The song, known for its melancholic lyrics and catchy melody, sampled Sting's "Shape of My Heart" and became a defining track of his career. Another early hit, "All Girls Are the Same," further solidified his place in the music scene, leading to a record deal with Interscope Records.
    </br>
  </br>
      His debut studio album, "Goodbye & Good Riddance" (2018), was well-received, showcasing his ability to blend hip-hop with emo and rock influences, addressing themes of heartbreak, depression, and drug use. The album included popular tracks like "Lean Wit Me" and "Wasted." Juice WRLD's collaborative project with Future, "Wrld on Drugs" (2018), and his second studio album, "Death Race for Love" (2019), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, further demonstrated his versatility and prolific output.
    </br>
  </br>
      Juice WRLD was known for his introspective lyrics and the emotional depth of his music, which resonated with a young audience grappling with similar issues. He openly discussed his struggles with mental health and substance abuse, aiming to provide solace and understanding through his art. His influence extended beyond his music, as he became a voice for a generation dealing with personal and societal challenges.
    </br>
  </br>
      Tragically, Juice WRLD passed away on December 8, 2019, at the age of 21, due to an accidental overdose. Despite his short life, his impact on the music industry was profound, with posthumous releases like the album "Legends Never Die" (2020) continuing to honor his legacy. Juice WRLD's contributions to music and his candidness about his struggles have left an enduring mark, ensuring that his influence will be felt for years to come.
